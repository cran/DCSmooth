Description: Nonparametric smoothing techniques for data on a lattice and
    functional time series. Smoothing is done via kernel regression or
    local polynomial regression, a bandwidth selection procedure based on
    an iterative plug-in algorithm is implemented. This package allows for
    modeling a dependency structure of the error terms of the
    nonparametric regression model.  Methods used in this paper are
    described in Feng/Schaefer (2021)
